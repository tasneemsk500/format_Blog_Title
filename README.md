# format_Blog_Title (solved problem from coddy.tech)
Converting user typed titles to Blog Title Formats

Create a function called formatBlogTitle that:

1) Takes a blog title string as input
2) Trims any whitespace from both ends
3) Makes the first character of each word uppercase
4) Replaces all occurrences of "Javascript" (case insensitive) with "JavaScript"
5) Returns the formatted title
Example Input:
